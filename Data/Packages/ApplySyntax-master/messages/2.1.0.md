# ApplySyntax 2.1.0

## New

- Updated and improved plugin system
    - Allow arguments to be passed to plugin method.
    - Load and keep loaded the current plugin at least for the duration of the ApplySyntax call so it can be used multiple times without reloading.
    - Deprecate the name attribute in favor of a standardized entry point
    - Move plugins to as_plugins

- Identify MXML files

- Add is_size.py plugin file for conditional file size checks; good for using plain text on really large files etc.
