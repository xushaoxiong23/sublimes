# ApplySyntax 2.0.0

## Changes

- `name` key has been deprecated in favor of `syntax` for clarity.
- `binary` key has been deprecated in favor of `interpreter` for clarity.
- `file_name` key has been deprecated in favor of `file_path` for clarity.
- `extensions` are used to evaluate syntax separately and before all other rules sets like Sublime does.  They are not included in **match all** rule sets.  This cleans up the settings considerably as these are the most common type matches that are done.  If you want to do **match all** rules with extensions, or you have more complex extension rules, you can utilize the `file_path` rule under the `rules` key.  `extensions` are now evaluated even if you don't want to add them to your language settings, but adding them to your language settings is still optional.

## Deprecation Warning!
As stated above, the following keys are now deprecated:

- `name` key has been deprecated in favor of `syntax` for clarity.
- `binary` key has been deprecated in favor of `interpreter` for clarity.
- `file_name` key has been deprecated in favor of `file_path` for clarity.

Please discontinue using them in favor of the new keys as they will be removed in the future.
